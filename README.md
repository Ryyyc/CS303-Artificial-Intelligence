# CS303 Artificial Intelligence

<br>

## Brief

CS301 Artificial Intelligence course projects in SUSTech 2020-Fall, include AI Algorithm for Reversi, Influence Maximization Problem, Text Classification.


More detail in documents  [Project1-Reversi](./doc/Project1-Reversi.pdf),  [Project2-IMP](Project2-IMP.pdf),  [Project3-Text_Classification](Project3-Text_Classification.pdf).


<br>

## Reversi

Chess game, use Mini-Max algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning.


<br>

## Influence Maximization Problem

This project has two computational tasks for IMPs. The first is to implement an estimation algorithm for the influence spread and the second is to design and implement a (seed set) search algorithm for IMPs.

<br>

## Text Classification

Use sklearn to predicts whether the text expresses positive or negative emotions.
